# WebLogging-IPs
The main purpose of this program was to learn how to monitor the number of visits to a particular website by a single person and to find unique IP addresses using the data structures ArrayList and HashMaps. 


This project was a coursera assignmnet on Java Programming where the instructors provided the WebLogParser class. In addition, they also provided few,
methods for each of the other classes, but the rest of the assignment was completed by me. Further on, they also provided pdf documents on what additional 
methods to code exactly.
